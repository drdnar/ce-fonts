# CE Fonts
Fonts for use with FontLibC for the TI-84 Plus CE

This has a few fonts available for the TI-84 Plus CE.
I actually had a fair bit of trouble finding any bitmap fonts from the 80s.
It seems suspiciously like people didn't start working on computized fonts until vector fonts came onto the scene.
Perhaps someone could dump fonts from an old laser or dot-matrix printer?
