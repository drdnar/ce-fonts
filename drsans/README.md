# Dr. Sans
This is a collection of fonts I've spend a lot of time developing.
The 9 and 10 size fonts are also good for use on small screens like on the TI-83 Plus series and TI-89 series.

My goal was to make these very readable.
I suggest adding at least one pixel of extra vertical space between lines if you're going to have large blocks of text.
The extra space really helps to prevent the eye from getting lost.

Yes, I know, I named the files after the cap height instead of total height.
That's how I think about them, even though `FontLibC` selects according to total heigh, not cap height.

### Design Notes
All sizes of Dr. Sans have a stroke (or at least an attempt at a stroke) through the zero to distinguish it from capital O.
All numerals have the same width, including the 1, specifically so that columns of numbers line up.
I'm not sure if the slightly irregular spacing of the 1 is the greater evil, but it's what I've decided to go with.

The 9-pixel size of Dr. Sans has an unusually squat look.
This is because standard practice is to make the tiniest sizes of a font a bit more squat, because it makes it more readable.

The 10-pixel size's bold weight also looks a bit squat.
Unfortunately, that's just a limitation of the tiny size of the font.
I can't really do 1.5-pixel-wide lines, after all.

I actually designed the bold weight of 14-pixel Dr. Sans first.
I've come to like the regular weight, too, though.
