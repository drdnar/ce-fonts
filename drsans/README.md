This is a collection of fonts I've spend a lot of time developing.
The 9 and 10 size fonts are also good for use on small screens like on the TI-83 Plus series and TI-89 series.

My goal was to make these very readable.
I suggest adding at least one pixel of extra vertical space between lines if you're going to have large blocks of text.
The extra space really helps to prevent the eye from getting lost.

Yes, I know, I named the files after the cap height instead of total height.
That's how I think about them, even though `FontLibC` selects according to total heigh, not cap height.
